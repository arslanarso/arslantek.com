            <h1 className="h3 md:h2 pb-8">Hi everyoneüëã</h1>
            <p className="paragraph">
              Hello üëã, I&apos;m Arslan, a self-taught enthusiastic Frontend
              Developer living in Izmir, Turkey. When I consider software as a
              philosophy, I realized that the constant feeling of being ‚Äúon the
              road‚Äù is invaluable.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph pt-6">
              My interest in user experience nourishes my passion for creating
              visual and functional interfaces, while my curiosity in different
              technologies boosts my quick adaptation and capacity to learn
              technically.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph pt-6">
              The software industry demands continuous learning, and this serves
              as a significant motivation for me. I enjoy working on open-source
              projects, being part of communities, and writing articles. The
              collaborative nature of the industry, its collective structure,
              the potential to produce innovative solutions, the joy of product
              development, along with the feedback culture, were the most
              crucial factors directing my career change.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph pt-6">
              My past managerial experience helps me make a positive impact on
              the team. I thrive on the knowledge I receive from experienced
              professionals and the dynamism brought by working with young team
              members.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph pt-6">
              Beyond coding, my goal is to witness the impact of products and
              services, contribute to the communities while constantly learning,
              and offer accessible and inclusive solutions for everyone. Outside
              of coding, I enjoy attending technology conferences and keeping up
              with industry trends.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph pt-6">
              In this journey, I see technology as an opportunity to improve
              life and I aim to go further every day.

            <p className="paragraph">
              I began my professional life in university. Initially, I gained
              experience in the accounting and finance sector, then took on
              broader responsibilities as a manager. I specialized in
              operational management and effectively directed relations with
              official institutions.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph pt-6">
              To boost productivity, I optimized workflows and reduced costs by
              efficiently using resources. I digitalized processes and gained
              valuable experiences by managing this transformation.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph pt-6">
              By strengthening supplier relations, I achieved cost advantages
              and operational efficiency. Together with the team, we initiated
              efforts to boost employee motivation, which contributed to
              speeding up processes.
            </p>
            <p className="paragraph pt-6">
              All of these experiences played a role in supporting organizations
              to operate seamlessly, efficiently, and harmoniously.
